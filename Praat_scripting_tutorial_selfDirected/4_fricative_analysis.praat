## This script will calculate the following measurements for a fricative segment 
##  from a set of soundfiles and corresponding textgrids:
##
##		duration
##		intensity
##		COG 
##		COG standard deviation
##		skewness
##		kurtosis
##		spectral slope		
##
## It will output the results to a text file.
