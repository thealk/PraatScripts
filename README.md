# Praat Scripts

At the moment the organization of these scripts is project-specific, which is helpful to me but likely exactly 0 other people. Many of the scripts themselves are project-agnostic, and could be easily generalizable (e.g., extracting all non-empty intervals from a textgrid, performing acoustic analysis x on all segments labelled y in a textgrid, etc.). At some point I'll make the organization of this more user friendly but today is not that day.

I also have a private collection of scripts that are just not really polished enough to put openly online. If you see something that looks potentially useful but not in its current form, feel free to reach out and I'll see if I have something more general, or can point you in the direction of how to clean it up in a way that's more useful for you.
